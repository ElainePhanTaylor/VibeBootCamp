## MVP Scope

### 1. Hero Section
- Your name
- One-line tagline (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer | Creative Problem Solver")
- Single CTA button ("View My Work" → scrolls to projects)

### 2. About Section
- 2-3 paragraph bio
- Simple skills list (text or styled tags)

### 3. Projects Section
- **3 project cards** (can add more later)
- Each card has:
  - Title
  - Short description (1-2 sentences)
  - Tech tags
  - Link button (demo or GitHub)

### 4. Contact Section
- Simple form: Name, Email, Message
- Basic validation (required fields, email format)
- Submit button with visual feedback (no backend—just shows success message)
- 2-3 social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)

### 5. Navigation
- Fixed/sticky nav bar
- Links to each section (smooth scroll)
- Mobile hamburger menu
